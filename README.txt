 📋 Project Description
This repository includes a Solidity-based project with various contracts, scripts, and tests for blockchain development and deployment. The primary focus is on smart contract management and blockchain application scenarios.

---

 🌟 Features
- Contains smart contracts for storage, ownership management, and a ballot system.
- A specialized contract for managing school certificates (`SchoolCertificate.sol`).
- Deployment scripts using both Ethers.js and Web3.js.
- Comprehensive testing suite for contracts.
- JSON configurations for scenarios and metadata.

---

 🛠 Requirements
- Node.js and npm
- Hardhat framework for Solidity development
- Solidity compiler (tested with version 0.8.x or higher)

---

 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MagedElgawish230/SchoolCertificateSystem.git
   cd SchoolCertificateSystem
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

 🚀 Usage

 Compile Contracts
1. Use Hardhat to compile the contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

 Deploy Contracts
1. Deploy using Ethers.js script:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_with_ethers.ts
   ```

2. Deploy using Web3.js script:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_with_web3.ts
   ```

 Run Tests
- Execute the test suite for contracts:
  ```bash
  npx hardhat test
  ```
